            <p>Please make sure to check your spam folder. If you still haven't received your activation email you can <a href="{{ url_for('auth.activate_request') }}">request another one</a>.</p>
            <li class="lead">The link in my activation email has expired.</li>
            <p>You can <a href="{{ url_for('auth.activate_request') }}">request another activation email</a> and try again. You will have another hour to activate your account using the new email link.</p>
            <li class="lead">I've forgotten my password.</li>
            <p>You can <a href="{{ url_for('auth.reset_password_request') }}">request a password reset</a> be emailed to you. You will have ten minutes to use the link in the email to change your password.</p>

        <h2>Time entries</h2>

            <li class="lead">Times recorded in my account are off by (x) hours.</li>
            <p>Please <a href="{{ url_for('account.update') }}">update your account</a> and select your required timezone from the drop down list.</p>    
            <li class="lead">How do I manually create a new time entry?</li>
            <p>Click on the down arrow on the right hand side of "Start/Stop now" and select <a href="{{ url_for('entry.manual') }}">Manual entry</a>.</p>    
            <li class="lead">Why limit to 80 entries per account? Why not 50, or 100?</li>
            <p>80 entries will give most people about two months worth of history, based on someone recording two entries per day, five days a week. Less than two months history doesn't feel like enough, and more than this starts to impact on the storage requirements and cost of running the service.</p>
            <li class="lead">What happens if I create a new entry after getting to the 80 limit?</li>
            <p>When you click on "start now" the oldest entry you have made will be automatically deleted and the new entry created.</p>
